    <p>
      It is important to discuss the goals of public transit. These goals are to
      carry a large number of people quickly and efficiently while connecting
      them to the areas they want to go. At first glance, this seems quite
      simple. If you just put a few bus stops around a city you'll have a
      successful bus network right? Unfortunately it isn't that easy. There are
      many factors that need to be considered for a public transit system to
      succeed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Firstly, there has to be a public transit station within a reasonable
      distance. Secondly, the public transit method has to be readily available
      without having to plan around it. This means that within 5 minutes or so
      of arriving to a station, you should be able to get on a train and be on
      your way to your destination. Third and most importantly, the public
      transit has to be faster and more convenient than driving.
    </p>

    <p>
      There is a great quote by the CEO of Mastercard that reads "An advanced
      city is not one where even the poor use cars, but rather one where even
      the rich use public transport. Or bicycles". This quote perfectly
      encapsulates how good a properly implemented public transit system can be
      because you know a public transit system is good when there are rich
      people using it.

        <h2>Types of Public Transit</h2>
        <h3>Busses</h3>

        <p>
          Busses are a type of public transit that is found very commonly in the
          U.S. Nearly every major city in the country has a bus network that
          aims to connect people to different parts of the city, or transport
          people from suburbs into the city.
        </p>

        <p>
          The problem that usually plagues bus networks is the fact that they're
          implemented as a patch fix for traffic rather than being prioritized.
          It is very often that you find a bus stuck in the same traffic riders
          look to avoid, making it an extremely inefficient method of transit at
          times. They also run into availability issues as a result of this
          traffic issue. Although it is not a simple fix, busses can be made a
          much better mode of transportation by implementing bus only lanes.
          This allows busses to essentially skip traffic which will allow them
          to carry people to their destinations more quickly, which in turn will
          likely increase ridership, lowering traffic in the area as well.
        </p>

        <h2>Trains</h2>
        <p>
          Trains are most commonly found in more urban cities in the U.S, with
          the occasional station being located in a suburban area to take people
          from their homes to work every day.
        </p>

        <p>
          This mode of transit also runs into availability issues, in which
          people typically have to wait 10~ minutes for the next train to be
          available, which makes them less inclined to ride.
        </p>

        <p>
          American trains are also not very accessible to people who aren't
          already driving. For example, it is extremely common to see a train
          station surrounded by an ocean of asphalt and parking spaces. This
          issue is very tightly weaved with America's car issue so it is not a
          simple fix.
        </p>

        <p>
          Train infrastructure done well is able to run at most hours of the
          day, have high availability, easy accessibility to people who aren't
          already driving, and connection to other types of public
          transportation, like busses .
        </p>

        <h2>Light Rail/Trams</h2>

        <p>
          Light rail (pictured at the top of this page) transit is a form of
          passenger urban rail transit characterized by a combination of tram
          and rapid transit features. While its rolling stock is more similar to
          a traditional tram, it operates at a higher capacity and speed, and
          often on an exclusive right-of-way.
        </p>
